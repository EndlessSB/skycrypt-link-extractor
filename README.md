# Skycrypt Link Extractor

**DISCLAIMER: THIS WAS MADE FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES WHATEVER YOU DO WITH THIS IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY**

## Features:

- Takes a file and then extracts all skycrypt links from it!

- IT prints those same skycrypt links to console

## Drawback:

- It only takes links with the begining "https://sky.shiiyu.moe/stats/"

- IT is a python script so if its a large file time to filter may vary

## Guide:

- Run the python script with like "py main.py file.txt"

- This is a command line argument based script! So run it as how it is said
